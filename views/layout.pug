          p  Hello! As an up-and-coming Software Engineer, I would like to welcome you to my portfolio! Here you can explore some of my past projects I have construsted for the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree. I am currently working as a Software Engineer Apprentice at Intuit, a wonderful opportunity partnered with AnitaB.org, with the mission to assist underrepresented women with finding their breakthrough into tech. I am also a part-time Data Analytics Captain for the non-profit organization, COOP. I facilitate workshops on professional development and teach foundational elements of SQL, Tableau, and Python to new grads seeking to overcome underemployment.
