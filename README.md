# My-Portfolio
 
This project is focused on creating a portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page sharing contact info and a brief description on myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail my past five projects from the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree. 

## Project Steps:
* I created a JSON file to store all the data about my past projects.
* Utilized Pug to work along the JSON to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser.
* Utilized Node.js and Express to:
    * Import the required dependencies
    * Link the JSON with the Pug templates
    * Set up routes to handle requests
    * Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
    * Handle errors
    * Set up a server to serve the project
